4. There is an error because the variable "result" was declared using "let" which has block scope. Since the line "console.log('final result: ', result);" is outside of the block of the if statement, it cannot access the result variable so an error is thrown.
5. The code will return an error since the variable "result" was declared with "const" and the value of "const" variables cannot be changed. The value of "result" was changed in the code so an error will be thrown.
